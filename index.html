			<p>CHARLESTON, SC - Local musician Stratton Moore, best known for his desktop-playing and snack-throwing in popular band <em>Sexbruise?</em> was arrested Friday morning and is currently facing counterfeiting charges, authorities said. The arrest came the day before the band was scheduled to perform at the Charleston Pourhouse for the 10th Annual Strap-on Face Funk.</p>

			<p>Police were tipped off by employees of a local UPS store who said Moore came into the store and printed $400,000 worth of fake $100 bills with his face on them. Police apprehended Moore several hours later at an Arby’s where he was trying to procure snacks with the fake currency.</p>

			<p>Moore was then taken to a police station where his bail was set at $25,000. Authorities said Moore tried to pay his bail with the fake currency, which he referred to as “Sexbruise? dollars”. Moore remains firm in his stance that <em>sexbruise?</em> dollars are “real” and “probably the next bitcoin”. </p>		</div>
